# BoT-SORT tracker integration stub
# Download the official BoT-SORT code and place the main tracker class here.
# For now, this is a placeholder. The real implementation will be added next.

        pass

    def update(self, detections):
        # Should return list of tracks in the format: [ [bbox, id, ...], ... ]
